I think there's beauty in stoicism, to persevere and attempt to achieve your goal no matter how bad things get. Not because you hope that things will turn out well in the end, but because that is what you want to do.   

No amount of disappointment will ever discourage you from wanting. I believe that that's where the real value of hard work lies, not expecting things to magically work out, but to work hard for your goal because it's a goal worth following.  

Even if it never happens, that's just what you want to do, so you pursue it, regardless of hope or lack of it, but just a deep drive that keeps you going towards your goal.

I think I really needed to ramble on for a while now, and I finally made time to do so.

It's not the usual type of post I do but It felt right to just write anything this time around.

As usual I'll make an attempt to keep this updated more often, and actually write a little bit more about computer science and videogames.
