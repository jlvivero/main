Last weekend I had my second visit to Mexico city, but I feel like I got to know a lot more about the lifestyle people that live here have. Last time I came here I came for only 2 days, and I stayed at an aunts apartment. The apartment was beautiful, it was in a very nice area, and it was very near where the event I was attending was. So I had very little interaction with people and the culture.  

This time around however, things have changed, I stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights. I stayed at my dad's apartment and the event was at the northern part of the city. So that meant I had to get to know a lot more, this time I was going to a wedding so I had 4 days to get to know the city.

I decided not to go to the parts of the city that the tourists usually go; Instead I went to visit friends at work and went out with them on their usual day, the first thing I noticed is the traffic. The traffic is definitely way worse than in my hometown, but that's not all, the driving culture is completely different. People are a lot more reckless and less respectful when driving but at the same time they respect road signs a whole lot more.

From that and seeing my friends and my dad work so many hours like it was a common thing made me realize how stressful this city is for living, nevertheless it has everything, any kind of fun, any kind of food, anything you like to see is there. So it really isn't that bad of a place.

While living can be stressful, it is not a bad place to go work for a few years, I wouldn't want to live there for long, but going to visit has always been fun.
