So after 8 years, I finally decided to buy a new desktop, I've been wanting to get around buying one for a while now but due to not having money or a single thing to my name I decided to wait until now.

The first thing I had to do was inform myself, I hadn't been up to date with computer parts since well 2008, and even then I have never been super involved in the topic. So the first thing I did was ask friends about it, and I found out there were generally two sides.  

- People who want a future proof computer: that means new generation the highest end specs so that your computer takes a long time to be obsolete.  

- People who don't believe future proof exists: that means they always go for the more bang for your buck and try to cut costs, because they know eventually even if you buy the best of the best it will become obsolete  

Now I think I'm somewhere in between, mainly because I want to be able to not need a major upgrade in at least a year. The reason behind this is because I'm in my last year of college, and I don't want to spend a huge amount of money until I graduate from college. This buy has to be able to work out for the remainder of my life in college.  


Another important thing is that I plan to work on the game industry as a developer, so that means my computer has to be able to run the latest game engines.

So after collecting the thoughts of some of my friends, I decided to go for a new gen build, focused on having a really good processor.

Now, because of the fact that I'm going for new gen that means that some parts are gonna be costly even if they're the cheaper alternatives, my initial budget was of 1k, and I was willing to go over the budget because I'm not buying the whole thing at once. The current end result is this:

- Intel Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz Quad-Core Processor: This is the bread and butter of my computer, what the main focus is, an i7 that's overclockeable, currently going at 345.88$, it is the priciest part of my future rig

- Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler: Since I'm gonna overclock my processor I need to be sure that i have some extra cooling for my rig so I just picked one that had good reviews and was affordable, currently going at 29.49$  

- Asus Z170-A ATX LGA1151 Motherboard: I'll be honest, motherboards is the topic I have the least knowledge about, I had another motherboard picked up, and my friend told me it was a waste of money, it had too many things I would never use, and since I know nothing about motherboards I listened, again I picked one that had good reviews and was the most affordable, making sure it was a new gen motherboard.  

- G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2133 Memory: I asked around and nobody seemed to pay much attention to what ram i used as long as it had enough space, and was DDR4, so nothing notable about this.  

- Samsung 850 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5" Solid State drive: Another problem I ran into is finding a good SSD drive that had high capacity and was affordable, Initially I didn't plan on spending much money on an SSD since I still have a perfectly functional hardware for data on my current computer. But now I'm considering selling my current rig (once I figure out how much it's worth) and maybe later on buy another SSD.  

- NZXT S340(Black) ATX Mid Tower Case: Nothing much to say about this except, I bought the cheapest once that looked okay and could have enough space for the rest of my parts, currently at 62.99$  

- EVGA SuperNOVA NEX 650W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply: I was told to go Gold Certified and that other than that pick the cheapest choice. I'm still debating between a 600-650W or sticking with the 750W. The price difference isn't that much, but I'm already slightly over budget so for now I'll stick to the 650W

- For video card, I still haven't decided yet, I'm most likely buying a RX 480 or a 1060 depending on the benchmarks that come out once the 1060 comes out.

Today I'm buying the first parts of my new computer which will be the SSD, I can put it on my old rig while I get the rest of the parts so it's the best choice.

That's all for today, this is my first time blogging, so I hope the read wasn't obnoxious. I'll probably try and keep it slightly shorter next time
